Day 1 - UK Employment Changes Dashboard üìä
Welcome to the "Day 1" project, where I created a Tableau dashboard to analyze and visualize changes in employment across the UK. This project is designed to showcase my ability to utilize various Tableau visualizations to present complex data in an interactive and insightful way.

Project Overview üöÄ
The primary goal of this project was to explore employment data across the UK, uncovering trends and patterns in employment changes over time. The dashboard features multiple visualizations to provide a comprehensive view of employment status, industries, and regions.

The dashboard contains the following visual elements:

Map Visualization: Displaying employment data geographically across the UK.
Tree Map: Highlighting key sectors and industries, showing the relative size of employment changes by sector.
Bar Chart: Offering a comparison of employment rates in different regions of the UK.
Bubble Graph: Showing the correlation between employment changes and other variables, such as population size.
Features and Visualizations üîç
1. Map Visualization
Displays geographical changes in employment across the UK.
Allows for quick identification of regions with significant employment changes.
Interactive features to zoom and filter by specific regions.

3. Tree Map
Provides a high-level overview of employment changes across various industries.
Visualizes which sectors have seen the most significant employment changes, allowing for easy comparison.

4. Bar Chart
Compares employment rates across different regions of the UK.
Helps users quickly spot trends in regional employment patterns.
Interactive filters to display specific data points by time period, sector, or region.

5. Bubble Graph
Displays the relationship between employment changes and region.
Allows users to filter and adjust the graph for a deeper dive into data insights.

Key Tableau Skills Used üõ†Ô∏è

Data Connection & Importing: Used Tableau‚Äôs data connection features to import and clean datasets for analysis, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

Calculated Fields: Applied calculated fields to derive new insights, such as employment change percentages, from raw data.
Filters & Parameters: Leveraged interactive filters and parameters to allow users to customize the data they view, focusing on specific regions, sectors, or timeframes.

Map Visualization: Utilized geographic data to create map-based visualizations, enabling location-based insights into employment trends across the UK.

Tree Map: Used Tree Map charts to display the relative size of employment changes by industry, making it easy to identify which sectors were most impacted.

Bar Charts & Bubble Graphs: Implemented bar charts and bubble graphs to effectively compare employment data across different categories and regions.

Slicers: Added slicers to enhance interactivity and allow users to quickly filter through large datasets for meaningful insights.

Tooltips & Annotations: Enhanced the dashboard by adding tooltips and annotations, providing extra information when hovering over data points for a more user-friendly experience.

Tools and Technologies üõ†Ô∏è
Tableau: The primary tool used to create this interactive dashboard.
Data: Employment data from publicly available sources detailing UK employment trends across different sectors and regions.

Project Objectives üéØ
Create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard to communicate insights about employment changes.
Use various Tableau visualizations (map, tree map, bar chart, bubble graph) to display data effectively.
Provide a tool for users to explore UK employment trends and make data-driven decisions based on the visualizations.

Day 2 - Sales Dashboard üìä
Welcome to the "Day 2" project! In this project, I created an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize sales data across various categories, delivery types, and regions. This dashboard provides insights into sales trends, helping businesses understand performance and identify areas of opportunity.

Project Overview üöÄ
The goal of this project was to analyze and visualize sales data to uncover trends and patterns related to product sub-categories, delivery types, order priorities, and regions. By using multiple Tableau visualizations, I provided an interactive and detailed look at key sales metrics over time.

Features and Visualizations üîç

Pie Chart: Showing distobution of sales across different order priorities.
Scatter Plot: Analyzing each subcategories sales and profits.
Line Graph: Displaying changes in cost of delivery over multiple years.
Bar Chart: Segmenting sales by year and showing sales by region, providing insights into geographical and operational performance.

Key Tableau Skills Used üõ†Ô∏è
Data Connection & Importing: Connected to multiple data sources to import and clean data for analysis in Tableau.

Calculated Fields: Created calculated fields to derive key sales metrics, such as average costs and total sales.

Filters & Parameters: Implemented interactive filters, enabling users to explore the dashboard by year, region, delivery type, or order priority.

Pie Chart & Bar Chart: Used pie charts for showing proportions of sales by order priority and bar charts for sales analysis by region and year.

Scatter Plot & Line Graph: Utilized scatter plots to analyze relationships between sales and profit of each subcategory, and line graphs to average delivery cost trends over time.

Grouping & Segmentation: Grouped sales data by years and segmented by product sub-category, delivery type, and region to enhance data analysis.

Tooltips & Annotations: Added tooltips to all charts for an interactive experience, allowing users to hover over data points for additional details.
